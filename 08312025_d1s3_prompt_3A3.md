PROMPT 3A3: Add CircuitBreaker to 2-Component Chain
SINGLE FOCUS: Add CircuitBreaker to existing TokenBucket + ConnectionPoolCore chain
EXPLICIT FILE PATHS:

Modify: tests/integration/2-component-chain.test.js
Import: CircuitBreaker component

INCREMENTAL IMPLEMENTATION:

Add CircuitBreaker with threshold 6 (Phase 2 finding)
Wrap existing 2-component chain with circuit breaker execution
Test circuit breaker opens after failures
Test circuit breaker protects rate limiting and connection pool
Validate with intentionally failed endpoints

CLEAR SUCCESS CRITERIA:

Test passes with 3-component chain
Circuit breaker opens after 6 failures
System continues working after circuit breaker opens
Good endpoints still accessible when circuit breaker active

REQUIREMENTS-BASED VALIDATION:

Circuit activation: Opens after exactly 6 failures
System protection: >50% requests succeed after circuit opens
Recovery capability: Circuit allows requests after cooldown
Chain integrity: Rate limiting still works with circuit breaker
