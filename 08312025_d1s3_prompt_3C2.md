PROMPT 3C2: Add HedgedManager to 6-Component Chain
SINGLE FOCUS: Add HedgedManager to existing 6-component chain
EXPLICIT FILE PATHS:

Modify: tests/integration/6-component-chain.test.js
Import: HedgedManager component

INCREMENTAL IMPLEMENTATION:

Add HedgedManager with 200ms hedge delay, 1 backup
Integrate hedged requests into existing 6-component flow
Test hedging improves success rate during endpoint issues
Test hedged request cleanup and Promise management
Validate hedging works with endpoint selection and batching

CLEAR SUCCESS CRITERIA:

Test passes with 7-component integrated chain (no orchestrator yet)
Hedged requests show success rate improvement >5%
No memory leaks from Promise cleanup
Different endpoints used for primary vs backup requests

REQUIREMENTS-BASED VALIDATION:

Success rate improvement: >5% compared to non-hedged requests
Endpoint diversity: Primary and backup use different endpoints >80% of time
Memory stability: No Promise leaks detected
Performance: <7000ms average latency with 7-component overhead
