  maxSockets: 50,
  timeout: 3000
});

// Execute request with pooling
const result = await pool.execute(url, {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify(payload),
  timeout: 5000
});

// Access metrics
const metrics = pool.getMetrics();
console.log(`Socket reuse: ${metrics.socketReusePercentage}`);
```
