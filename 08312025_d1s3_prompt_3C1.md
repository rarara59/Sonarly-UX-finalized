PROMPT 3C1: Add BatchManager to Extended Chain
SINGLE FOCUS: Add BatchManager to existing 5-component chain
EXPLICIT FILE PATHS:

Create: tests/integration/6-component-chain.test.js
Import: BatchManager + existing 5 components

INCREMENTAL IMPLEMENTATION:

Add BatchManager with 100ms window, 8 max batch size
Integrate batching into existing 5-component request flow
Test request batching reduces actual RPC calls
Test batch response routing returns correct results to callers
Validate batching doesn't interfere with caching or rate limiting

CLEAR SUCCESS CRITERIA:

Test passes with 6-component integrated chain
Batch efficiency >40% (fewer RPC calls than requests)
Response routing 100% accurate (each caller gets correct response)
Existing optimization components still functional

REQUIREMENTS-BASED VALIDATION:

Batch efficiency: >40% reduction in actual RPC calls
Response accuracy: 100% correct routing to original callers
Success rate: >55% with 6-component overhead
Integration integrity: Cache, rate limiting, circuit breaker functional
