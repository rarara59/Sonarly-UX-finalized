# PPG Frame Processor JavaScript Implementation Report

## ‚úÖ Implementation Completed Successfully

### Changes Made:

#### 1. **BiometricCaptureScreen.js Updates**
   - Added imports for `useFrameProcessor` and `runOnJS` from react-native-reanimated
   - Created `detectPPG` frame processor registration file
   - Implemented frame processor hook with worklet function
   - Added PPG data state management
   - Added debug overlay showing frame count and PPG data
   - Integrated hidden Camera component with frame processor prop

#### 2. **New File Created: src/frameProcessors/detectPPG.js**
   ```javascript
   // Registers the native detectPPG plugin globally
   const plugin = VisionCameraProxy.getFrameProcessorPlugin('detectPPG');
   global.detectPPG = detectPPG;
   ```

#### 3. **Camera Component Integration**
   - Camera now activates when reading state begins
   - Frame processor attached to Camera component
   - Torch/flash enabled for better PPG detection
   - Hidden camera view (1x1 pixel) to avoid UI disruption

### Implementation Details:

#### Frame Processor Flow:
1. User presses "I'm Ready" ‚Üí `startReading()` called
2. Camera activates with `setIsCameraActive(true)`
3. Frame processor runs on each frame (30 FPS)
4. Native `detectPPG` processes frame and returns data
5. `handlePPGData` receives results on JS thread
6. Debug overlay shows frame dimensions and count
7. After 10 seconds, camera deactivates

#### Debug Features Added:
- Frame counter showing processed frames
- PPG data display (width, height, timestamp)
- Error logging if frame processor fails
- Camera device detection and setup logging

### Verification Results:
```
‚úÖ detectPPG.js exists
‚úÖ useFrameProcessor imported
‚úÖ runOnJS imported  
‚úÖ detectPPG imported
‚úÖ Frame processor hook implemented
‚úÖ PPG data handler implemented
‚úÖ Camera has frameProcessor prop
‚úÖ Camera torch enabled for PPG
```

## Testing Instructions:

### Build and Run:
1. **Open Xcode**
   ```bash
   open ios/Sonarly.xcworkspace
   ```

2. **Clean Build Folder**
   - Press `Cmd+Shift+K`

3. **Build Project**
   - Press `Cmd+B`
   - Verify "Compiling PPGFrameProcessor.m" in build output

4. **Run on Device/Simulator**
   - Press `Cmd+R`

### Test Frame Processor:
1. Launch the app
2. Navigate to BiometricCaptureScreen
3. Grant camera permission when prompted
4. Press "Continue with Camera"
5. Press "I'm Ready" to start detection
6. **Look for debug overlay showing:**
   - "üî¥ Starting PPG reading..."
   - "üé• Camera activated"
   - "üìè Frame: [width]x[height], Count: [number]"
   - Frame count should increment rapidly (30 FPS)

### Expected Console Output:
```
üî¥ PPG Frame processor called! Frame: <Frame>
‚úÖ Image buffer exists
üìè Frame dimensions: 1920 x 1080
üì§ Returning result: { width: 1920, height: 1080, ... }
üé• Frame processor called
üîç detectPPG result: { width: 1920, height: 1080, ... }
üî¥ PPG Data received: { width: 1920, height: 1080, ... }
```

## Troubleshooting:

### If frame processor doesn't run:
1. Check Xcode console for "‚úÖ PPG Frame processor registered as 'detectPPG'"
2. Verify camera permission is granted
3. Check that torch/flash is working (should turn on during reading)
4. Ensure device has a back camera

### If you see "detectPPG is not defined":
1. Rebuild the app completely
2. Check that PPGFrameProcessor.m is in Compile Sources
3. Verify the native module is loaded on app start

### If Camera doesn't activate:
1. Check camera permissions in device settings
2. Verify camera device is detected (check debug overlay)
3. Try on a real device instead of simulator (simulator camera limited)

## Files Modified:
1. `/src/screens/BiometricCaptureScreen.js` - Added frame processor implementation
2. `/src/frameProcessors/detectPPG.js` - Created frame processor registration
3. `/scripts/verify-ppg-javascript.sh` - Created verification script

## Next Steps for Production:
1. Implement actual PPG algorithm in native code
2. Add heart rate calculation from PPG signal
3. Add signal quality indicators
4. Implement retry logic for poor readings
5. Add visual feedback during detection
6. Store and analyze PPG data for trends

## Status:
‚úÖ **Native Integration:** Complete  
‚úÖ **JavaScript Integration:** Complete  
üéØ **Ready for Testing:** Yes

The PPG frame processor system is now fully integrated and ready for testing on device!
