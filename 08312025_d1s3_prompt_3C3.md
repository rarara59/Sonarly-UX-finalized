PROMPT 3C3: Integrate RpcManager Orchestrator
SINGLE FOCUS: Replace manual component chaining with RpcManager orchestrator
EXPLICIT FILE PATHS:

Create: tests/integration/orchestrated-system.test.js
Import: RpcManager, ComponentFactory + all components

INCREMENTAL IMPLEMENTATION:

Use ComponentFactory to create all 7 components with dependencies
Initialize RpcManager with all components
Replace manual component chaining with single rpcManager.call()
Test complete orchestrated request flow
Validate orchestrator coordinates all 7 components correctly

CLEAR SUCCESS CRITERIA:

Test passes with RpcManager orchestrating all components
Single rpcManager.call() executes complete request flow
Component coordination works without manual chaining
System metrics available from RpcManager

REQUIREMENTS-BASED VALIDATION:

Orchestration success: rpcManager.call() works end-to-end
Component coordination: All 7 components participate in request flow
System health: getSystemMetrics() returns health for all components
Performance: <8000ms average with complete orchestration
