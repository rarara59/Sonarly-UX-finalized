PROBLEM IDENTIFIED: Memory cleanup patterns implemented but growth still above <2%/hour target due to unbounded arrays and queues

SINGLE FOCUS: Implement hard bounds on all memory-accumulating structures to achieve <2%/hour growth

EXPLICIT FILE: src/detection/transport/rpc-connection-pool.js - Add memory bounds to prevent unbounded growth

INCREMENTAL PROCESS:
Step 1: Add hard cap to request queue with oldest-drop behavior (MAX_QUEUE = 500)
Step 2: Add bounds to per-endpoint latency and error arrays (MAX_SAMPLES = 64) 
Step 3: Add bounds to circuit breaker failure tracking (MAX_CB_EVENTS = 50)
Step 4: Optimize queue pruning with single-pass expired item removal
Step 5: Enhanced cleanup for timers, controllers, and response retention
Step 6: Test sustained load with memory measurement over 10 minutes
Step 7: Validate <2%/hour growth rate achieved

CLEAR SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- Memory growth reduces to <2%/hour measured over 10+ minutes sustained load
- Request queue never exceeds 500 items (oldest-drop when full)
- Endpoint arrays never exceed 64 samples (ring buffer behavior)
- Circuit breaker state bounded to 50 events maximum
- Success rate maintains 90%+ (no functional regression)
- All bounds enforce automatically without manual intervention

REQUIREMENTS-BASED VALIDATION:
MEASURE: Memory usage every minute during 10-minute sustained load test with --expose-gc flag
ACHIEVE: <2%/hour growth rate enabling true 24/7 trading operation capability  
NOT: Complex memory management algorithms or garbage collection tuning

KNOWN SOLUTION AREAS (for Claude Code guidance):
- Queue bounds: Hard cap with FIFO oldest-drop when at limit
- Array bounds: Ring buffer behavior with shift() when exceeding limits
- State bounds: Constant memory usage for diagnostic/tracking arrays  
- Cleanup enhancement: Timer/controller reference breaking and response trimming
- Validation approach: Extrapolate growth rate from 10-minute measurement

SPECIFIC IMPLEMENTATION PATTERNS:
- Use constants for all bounds (MAX_QUEUE, MAX_SAMPLES, MAX_CB_EVENTS)
- Implement oldest-drop with shift() for FIFO behavior
- Add bounds checks before push operations on arrays
- Enhance existing cleanup patterns with explicit nulling
- Trim stored response objects to boolean status only
- Optional: Add defensive 1-minute guard with unref() for cap enforcement
