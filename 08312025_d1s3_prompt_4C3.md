PROMPT 4C3: Cascading Failure Prevention
SINGLE FOCUS: Test system prevents cascading failures during multiple component issues
EXPLICIT FILE PATHS:

Create: scripts/test-cascade-prevention.js
Import: Complete system with failure simulation capabilities

INCREMENTAL IMPLEMENTATION:

Simulate simultaneous failure of 2 components (e.g., Cache + Batch)
Test system response to multiple network endpoints failing
Validate circuit breaker prevents cascading request failures
Test system recovery from multiple simultaneous failures
Measure minimum system capability during worst-case scenarios

CLEAR SUCCESS CRITERIA:

System survives simultaneous failure of 2 components
Circuit breaker prevents request storms during multiple failures
System maintains >50% functionality during multiple component failures
No cascading failures that crash entire system

REQUIREMENTS-BASED VALIDATION:

Multi-failure tolerance: >50% functionality with 2 failed components
Cascade prevention: Circuit breaker prevents request amplification
Recovery coordination: System can recover from multiple simultaneous failures
Minimum capability: System provides basic RPC functionality even with multiple failures
