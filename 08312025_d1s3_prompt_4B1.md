PROMPT 4B1: Memory Growth Measurement Setup
SINGLE FOCUS: Set up memory monitoring and measurement infrastructure
EXPLICIT FILE PATHS:

Create: scripts/memory-monitor.js
Create: scripts/component-memory-tracker.js

INCREMENTAL IMPLEMENTATION:

Create memory monitoring utility that tracks system memory usage
Create component-specific memory tracking for all 7 components
Add memory sampling every 30 seconds during tests
Create memory growth rate calculation functions
Test memory tracking works correctly with complete system

CLEAR SUCCESS CRITERIA:

Memory monitor tracks total system memory usage
Component tracker identifies memory usage per component
Memory sampling works during system operation
Memory data saves to file for analysis

REQUIREMENTS-BASED VALIDATION:

Monitoring accuracy: Memory readings within 5% of actual usage
Component isolation: Can identify memory usage per component
Sample frequency: Captures memory every 30 seconds reliably
Data persistence: Memory data saves correctly for later analysis
