PROMPT 4B1: Meme Coin Trading Load Baseline
SINGLE FOCUS: Establish performance baseline under realistic meme coin detection patterns with mathematical memory measurement
EXPLICIT FILE PATHS:

CREATE: scripts/trading-load-baseline.js
CREATE: scripts/memory-tracker.js
CREATE: results/baseline-metrics.json (output)
CREATE: results/memory-growth-data.json (output)
IMPORT: Complete validated system from 4A

INCREMENTAL IMPLEMENTATION:

Configure realistic meme coin detection patterns (30% new LPs, 40% balance checks, 20% token supply, 10% duplicates)
Initialize memory tracking for all 7 components individually
Execute 60-minute sustained detection load at 25 requests per minute
Monitor component performance, cache effectiveness, and error rates
Track memory usage every 30 seconds with per-component breakdown
Test system stability during simulated viral meme events (5x request volume)
Calculate memory growth rates and establish performance baseline

CLEAR SUCCESS CRITERIA:

System maintains >85% success rate during 60-minute meme coin detection load
Memory tracking captures per-component usage throughout test duration
System handles 5x volume spikes without critical failures
Baseline performance metrics established for production comparison
Memory growth patterns measured for PM2 restart calculation

REQUIREMENTS-BASED VALIDATION:

Detection Success Rate: >85% throughout 60-minute test under meme coin patterns
Memory Growth: <100MB total growth during 60-minute sustained operation
Component Performance: All 7 components maintain functionality under load
Spike Handling: >70% success rate during 5x volume viral event simulation
Performance Consistency: <25% latency increase from start to end of test
Memory Per Component: Individual growth rates measured for each component
