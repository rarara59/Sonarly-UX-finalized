PROBLEM IDENTIFIED: PM2 configuration has 150MB memory limit causing restarts every 15-20 minutes instead of target 4-hour cycles for 99.986% uptime

SINGLE FOCUS: Calculate and configure optimal PM2 memory limits based on measured 578%/hour growth rate to achieve 4-hour restart cycles

EXPLICIT FILES:
- Primary: ecosystem.config.js - Update memory limits for 4-hour restart cycles
- Secondary: scripts/calculate-memory-limits.js - Memory growth calculation script
- Validation: scripts/validate-restart-frequency.js - Test 4-hour restart timing

INCREMENTAL PROCESS:
Step 1: Calculate optimal memory limit based on 578%/hour growth from 50MB baseline over 4-hour period
Step 2: Set max_memory_restart to calculated value plus 20% safety margin  
Step 3: Set max-old-space-size to 150% of restart limit for adequate headroom
Step 4: Configure restart parameters for graceful 4-hour cycles (min_uptime, max_restarts)
Step 5: Add memory growth monitoring to validate 4-hour restart prediction
Step 6: Test configuration with memory simulation to verify restart timing
Step 7: Generate production-ready ecosystem.config.js with optimized limits

CLEAR SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- Memory limits calculated mathematically: 50MB * 578% growth * 4 hours = ~400MB restart threshold
- PM2 restarts occur every 4 hours Â±30 minutes (not every 15-20 minutes)
- System achieves 99.986% uptime target (10 seconds downtime per 4-hour cycle)
- Graceful shutdown and restart process completes within 10 seconds
- No frequent restart alerts or instability due to aggressive limits
- Production-ready configuration requires zero manual tuning after deployment

REQUIREMENTS-BASED VALIDATION:
MEASURE: PM2 restart frequency and memory usage patterns over 8-hour test period
ACHIEVE: 4-hour restart cycles with mathematical precision based on growth rate data
NOT: Conservative deployment requiring post-deployment optimization or aggressive limits causing frequent restarts

CRITICAL CALCULATION: 578%/hour growth rate from 50MB baseline = 289MB growth per hour = 1,156MB total after 4 hours, set restart at ~400MB with safety margin for Node.js overhead

PRODUCTION TARGET: Single deployment with correct memory limits achieving 99.986% uptime without further tuning required
