PROMPT 0C: Integration Error Handler
SINGLE FOCUS: Create error handling system for component failure isolation and recovery
EXPLICIT FILE PATHS:

Target: src/detection/transport/integration-error-handler.js
Integration Point: Used by RpcManager orchestrator for error handling

INCREMENTAL IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS:
Step 1: Create error classification system (component errors vs system errors vs network errors)
Step 2: Implement component failure detection and automatic isolation mechanisms
Step 3: Create fallback strategies for when individual components fail or become unavailable
Step 4: Add component recovery detection and automatic re-integration capability
Step 5: Test error handling with simulated component failures for all 7 components
CLEAR SUCCESS CRITERIA:
Error Handling Requirements:

Component failure isolation: Failed components don't affect other working components
Fallback strategies: System continues with degraded but functional capability during failures
Recovery detection: Automatically re-integrate components when they become healthy again
Error propagation: Clear error messages indicate exactly which component failed and why

Fallback Strategy Design:
// Component-specific fallback behaviors:
TokenBucket failure → Disable rate limiting, continue with warning logs
CircuitBreaker failure → Disable circuit breaking, use basic retry with backoff
EndpointSelector failure → Use simple round-robin without health checking
ConnectionPoolCore failure → Use basic HTTP requests without connection pooling
RequestCache failure → Disable caching, continue without request deduplication  
BatchManager failure → Send individual requests instead of batching
HedgedManager failure → Use single requests instead of parallel hedged requests

REQUIREMENTS-BASED VALIDATION:
Measure These Metrics:

Failure isolation effectiveness (target: 100% of component failures properly isolated)
Fallback strategy success rate (target: 80%+ system capability maintained during failures)
Recovery detection accuracy (target: 100% of recovered components automatically re-integrated)
Error message clarity (target: 100% of failures clearly attributed to specific component)
