PROBLEM IDENTIFIED: Success rate 90.2% blocks production deployment (target: 95%+ required)

SINGLE FOCUS: Optimize RPC connection parameters to achieve 95%+ success rate

EXPLICIT FILE: src/detection/transport/rpc-connection-pool.js - Tune connection and timeout parameters

INCREMENTAL PROCESS:
Step 1: Profile current failure patterns (analyze which RPC calls fail and why)
Step 2: Optimize connection pool sizing (concurrent connections, queue limits)
Step 3: Tune timeout parameters (request timeout, connection timeout, retry timing)
Step 4: Test success rate ≥95% over 1000 requests with 20 concurrent load
Step 5: Validate no latency regression (maintain <200ms P95 response time)

CLEAR SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- Success rate improves from 90.2% to ≥95% measured over 1000+ requests
- System maintains 95%+ success during 10+ minute sustained load test
- P95 latency remains <200ms (no performance regression from optimization)
- Failover timing maintains <5 second budget (Toyota fix preserved)

REQUIREMENTS-BASED VALIDATION:
MEASURE: Success rate percentage during sustained load with real Solana RPC endpoints
ACHIEVE: ≥95% success rate enabling production meme coin trading deployment
NOT: Complex retry algorithms or sophisticated connection management systems

KNOWN OPTIMIZATION AREAS (for Claude Code guidance):
- Connection pool parameters (max concurrent, queue size, connection reuse)
- Timeout configuration (request timeout, connection establishment timeout)
- RPC provider settings (rate limits, keepalive, connection pooling)
- Failure handling (quick fail vs retry patterns for different error types)

CURRENT SYSTEM STATE:
- Memory leak: FIXED (24/7 operation enabled)
- Endpoint failover: WORKING (Toyota fix delivering <5s failover)
- Success rate: 90.2% (need 4.8 percentage point improvement)
- Performance: P95 latency acceptable, throughput stable
