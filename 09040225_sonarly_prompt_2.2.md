# Sonarly VisionCamera Fix: Complete Step-by-Step Sequence

## Current Status
✅ **COMPLETED:** Native `PPGFrameProcessor.m` integrated into Xcode project  
❌ **REMAINING:** JavaScript frame processor implementation  
🎯 **GOAL:** Complete VisionCamera PPG heart rate detection system

---

### Prompt 2.2: Test Frame Processor Registration

```
Verify that the frame processor is properly registered and callable from JavaScript.

1. Check that VisionCameraPluginRegistry.mm properly registers the detectPPG processor
2. Add console logging to verify the frame processor is being called
3. Build and run on simulator first to check for registration errors
4. Add JavaScript-side logging to see if frames are being processed
5. Test the complete flow: camera activation → frame processing → PPG data

Focus on getting debug logs to appear that show the frame processor is being invoked. Look for the native debug logs with emoji prefixes (🚀, ✅, 🔴, 📏, 📤).
```

**Expected Output:** Console logs showing frame processor being called
