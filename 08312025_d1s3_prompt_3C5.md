PROMPT 3C5: System Performance Baseline Validation
SINGLE FOCUS: Validate complete system meets performance requirements for production use
EXPLICIT FILE PATHS:

Create: tests/integration/performance-baseline.test.js
Import: Complete orchestrated system

INCREMENTAL IMPLEMENTATION:

Execute 100 requests through complete system for statistical baseline
Measure success rate, latency, throughput under sustained load
Compare against original 98% success rate target (aim for 90%+)
Test system recovery after simulated component failures
Validate system ready for Phase 4 production testing

CLEAR SUCCESS CRITERIA:

System achieves >90% success rate over 100 requests
Average latency reasonable for real network conditions (<10s)
System recovers gracefully from individual component failures
Performance baseline established for Phase 4 comparison

REQUIREMENTS-BASED VALIDATION:

Success rate: >90% over 100 real Solana RPC requests
Latency: <10000ms average end-to-end with complete system
Recovery capability: >80% functionality maintained during component failures
Throughput: Complete 100 requests in <15 minutes
