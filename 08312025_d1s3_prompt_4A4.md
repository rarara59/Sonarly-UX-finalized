PROMPT 4A4: Performance Baseline Establishment
SINGLE FOCUS: Establish performance baseline for production comparison
EXPLICIT FILE PATHS:

Create: scripts/establish-baseline.js
Create: results/baseline-metrics.json (output file)

INCREMENTAL IMPLEMENTATION:

Execute 100 requests through complete system for statistical baseline
Measure success rate, latency percentiles, throughput
Record component-level performance metrics
Save baseline metrics to JSON file for Phase 4B comparison
Validate system meets minimum production requirements

CLEAR SUCCESS CRITERIA:

Baseline test completes 100 requests successfully
Success rate >90% with real Solana network
Baseline metrics saved to results file
System performance acceptable for production use

REQUIREMENTS-BASED VALIDATION:

Success rate: >90% over 100 real RPC requests
P95 latency: <10 seconds end-to-end
Throughput: >10 requests per minute sustained
Baseline data: Complete metrics saved to file for comparison
