PROMPT 3B: Subsystem Integration Testing
SINGLE FOCUS: Test 3-4 component logical subsystems working together
EXPLICIT FILE PATHS:

Target: tests/integration/subsystem.test.js
Subsystems Under Test: Logical groupings of 3-4 related components

INCREMENTAL IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS:
Step 1: Test Rate Limiting Subsystem (TokenBucket + CircuitBreaker + EndpointSelector coordination)
Step 2: Test Request Optimization Subsystem (RequestCache + BatchManager + HedgedManager efficiency)
Step 3: Test Connection Management Subsystem (ConnectionPoolCore + EndpointSelector + CircuitBreaker)
Step 4: Test cross-subsystem interactions (ensure no conflicts between different subsystem groups)
Step 5: Test complete subsystem failure recovery and graceful degradation scenarios
CLEAR SUCCESS CRITERIA:
Subsystem Integration Requirements:

Rate Limiting Subsystem: Combined rate limiting, circuit breaking, and endpoint selection work cohesively
Request Optimization: Caching, batching, and hedging optimizations work together effectively
Connection Management: Core connections with intelligent selection and circuit protection
Cross-subsystem compatibility: No conflicts or interference between different subsystem groups

Performance Requirements:

Subsystem end-to-end latency: <100ms for typical operations with all components active
Memory efficiency: 3-4 components use resources efficiently together
Failure isolation: Subsystem failures don't cascade to affect other independent subsystems
Recovery capability: Subsystems recover gracefully from individual component failures

REQUIREMENTS-BASED VALIDATION:
Measure These Metrics:

End-to-end subsystem latency (target: <100ms for realistic operations with full optimization)
Failure isolation effectiveness (target: 100% of failures contained within originating subsystem)
Recovery time after failures (target: <30 seconds to restore full subsystem functionality)
Resource utilization efficiency (target: Combined usage < 120% of sum of individual components)
