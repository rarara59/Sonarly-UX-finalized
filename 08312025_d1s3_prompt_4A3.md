PROMPT 4A3: Component Optimization Validation
SINGLE FOCUS: Validate each component provides measurable optimization benefit
EXPLICIT FILE PATHS:

Create: scripts/validate-component-benefits.js
Import: Complete system + component metrics

INCREMENTAL IMPLEMENTATION:

Execute 50 requests with component optimizations enabled
Measure cache hit rate, batch efficiency, hedging improvement
Compare performance with vs without specific optimizations
Validate each component contributes measurable benefit
Test optimization effectiveness under realistic patterns

CLEAR SUCCESS CRITERIA:

RequestCache shows >25% hit rate with realistic patterns
BatchManager shows >30% RPC call reduction
HedgedManager shows >5% success rate improvement
Circuit breaker and endpoint selector contribute to reliability

REQUIREMENTS-BASED VALIDATION:

Cache effectiveness: >25% hit rate with meme coin patterns
Batch efficiency: >30% reduction in actual RPC calls
Hedging benefit: >5% success rate improvement during endpoint issues
Component health: All optimizations functional without conflicts
