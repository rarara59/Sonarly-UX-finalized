PROMPT 4C1: Network Failure Simulation
SINGLE FOCUS: Test system behavior during network connectivity issues
EXPLICIT FILE PATHS:

Create: scripts/test-network-failures.js
Create: scripts/network-failure-simulator.js

INCREMENTAL IMPLEMENTATION:

Create network failure simulator that can block specific endpoints
Test system response when Helius endpoint becomes unavailable
Test system response when multiple endpoints fail simultaneously
Validate circuit breaker and endpoint selector handle failures correctly
Test system recovery when failed endpoints come back online

CLEAR SUCCESS CRITERIA:

System continues operating when individual endpoints fail
Circuit breaker activates and protects system during failures
Endpoint selector fails over to healthy endpoints
System recovers automatically when endpoints restore

REQUIREMENTS-BASED VALIDATION:

Failure detection: Circuit breaker opens within 6 failed requests
Failover speed: Endpoint selector switches to healthy endpoints in <10 seconds
Continued operation: >60% success rate maintained during single endpoint failure
Recovery time: <30 seconds to return to normal operation after endpoint recovery
