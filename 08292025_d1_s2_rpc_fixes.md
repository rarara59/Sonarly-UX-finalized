Fix the RPC Connection Pool performance failures identified in stress testing.

PERFORMANCE FAILURES IDENTIFIED:
- P95 latency: 77-172ms (TARGET: <30ms)  
- Success rate under load: 5-25% (TARGET: >99.9%)
- System fails during viral meme events (highest profit scenarios)
- Contradictory success rate reporting in stress test

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS REQUIRED:
The failures indicate architectural problems, not configuration issues. Fix these core problems:

1. **PER-ENDPOINT RATE LIMITING VIOLATIONS**
   - Current implementation likely exceeds individual RPC provider limits
   - Helius: 50 req/s, ChainStack: 40 req/s, Public: 10 req/s (estimated)
   - Need proper per-endpoint rate limiting instead of global limits

2. **POOR LOAD DISTRIBUTION** 
   - Requests not properly distributed across 3 endpoints
   - Round-robin may be failing under concurrent load
   - Need intelligent load balancing that respects endpoint capabilities

3. **AGGRESSIVE CIRCUIT BREAKER BEHAVIOR**
   - Circuit breaker opening too quickly under load spikes
   - Need load-aware thresholds that distinguish between endpoint failure vs overload
   - Should gracefully degrade, not fail catastrophically

4. **CONNECTION POOL BOTTLENECKS**
   - HTTP keep-alive connections may be misconfigured
   - Agent pooling not optimized for concurrent requests
   - Need proper connection management for high throughput

5. **MISSING REQUEST QUEUING WITH BACKPRESSURE**
   - System fails requests instead of queuing them during spikes
   - Need bounded queues that provide backpressure instead of immediate failure
   - Critical for handling viral meme event traffic spikes

MEME COIN TRADING CONTEXT:
- Normal: 1-5 tokens analyzed simultaneously
- Viral events: 50-100+ tokens need immediate analysis
- Biggest profits occur during viral events when high concurrency is required
- System must handle both scenarios with >99.9% reliability

PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS (DO NOT LOWER):
- P95 latency: <30ms for competitive advantage
- Success rate: >99.9% during high load (viral meme events)
- Throughput: Handle 1000+ TPS bursts
- Memory stability: <5MB/min growth over 10+ minute sustained load

ARCHITECTURAL FIXES REQUIRED:

1. **IMPLEMENT PER-ENDPOINT RATE LIMITING**
```javascript
// Replace global rate limiting with per-endpoint limits
const endpointConfigs = [
  { url: process.env.HELIUS_RPC_URL, rpsLimit: 45, weight: 60 },
  { url: process.env.CHAINSTACK_RPC_URL, rpsLimit: 35, weight: 30 },  
  { url: process.env.PUBLIC_RPC_URL, rpsLimit: 8, weight: 10 }
];
```

2. **FIX LOAD BALANCING ALGORITHM**
   - Implement weighted round-robin that respects endpoint capacity
   - Track per-endpoint load and avoid overloaded endpoints
   - Distribute concurrent requests intelligently across all endpoints

3. **OPTIMIZE CIRCUIT BREAKER LOGIC**
   - Different failure thresholds for different error types
   - Rate limiting errors should not trigger circuit breaker  
   - Gradual recovery instead of binary OPEN/CLOSED states

4. **IMPLEMENT REQUEST QUEUING**
   - Bounded queues per endpoint with backpressure handling
   - Queue requests during spikes instead of failing them
   - Configurable queue sizes and timeout handling

5. **OPTIMIZE HTTP CONNECTION MANAGEMENT**
   - Proper HTTP agent configuration for concurrent requests
   - Connection pooling optimized for RPC call patterns
   - Keep-alive settings tuned for trading system requirements

STRESS TEST IMPROVEMENTS:
Fix the stress test to provide accurate measurements:
- Separate reporting for concurrent vs final pool statistics
- Per-endpoint success rate tracking
- Latency percentile calculations that match real usage
- Memory growth measurement improvements

VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
After fixes, the stress test must show:
- P95 latency: <30ms under realistic load (20-50 concurrent requests)
- Success rate: >99.5% even during 200+ concurrent request spikes
- Graceful degradation: System slows down but doesn't fail during overload
- Memory stability: <2MB/min growth over 10+ minutes
- Per-endpoint statistics: Each endpoint operating within its limits

TRADING SYSTEM INTEGRATION:
- Ensure fixes don't break existing Session 1 component interface
- Maintain compatibility with Session 2 system integration
- Test with actual Solana RPC calls (getSlot, getTokenSupply, etc.)
- Verify circuit breaker and failover behavior under realistic conditions

DO NOT:
- Lower performance targets or requirements
- Accept mediocre performance as "realistic" 
- Mask problems with configuration changes
- Break existing component interfaces

FIX THE ARCHITECTURAL ISSUES to achieve the original performance targets required for profitable meme coin trading during viral market events.

Run the improved stress test and show that all performance targets are met with the architectural fixes in place.
