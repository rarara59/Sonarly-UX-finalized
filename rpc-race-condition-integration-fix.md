# RPC Race Condition Integration Fix

## Changes Applied

### 1. Added validateTokenWithRetry to LP Detector Service
- Moved retry logic from tiered-token-filter to the main LP detection pipeline
- Added validation queue initialization in constructor
- Integrated validation BEFORE the confidence-based bypass decision

### 2. Modified LP Candidate Processing Flow
Now follows this order:
1. **Token Validation First** - Always validate token with retry logic
2. **Confidence Check Second** - Only bypass mathematical validation if token is valid
3. **Mathematical Validation** - Applied to lower-confidence candidates with valid tokens

### 3. Key Integration Points

#### In liquidity-pool-creation-detector.service.js:
```javascript
// Always validate token first (even for high-confidence candidates)
if (candidate.tokenMint || candidate.tokenAddress) {
  const tokenMint = candidate.tokenMint || candidate.tokenAddress;
  const validationResult = await this.validateTokenWithRetry(tokenMint);
  
  if (!validationResult.success) {
    console.log(`❌ Token validation failed for ${tokenMint}: ${validationResult.error}`);
    continue; // Skip this candidate
  }
  
  console.log(`✅ Token validation successful for ${tokenMint}`);
}

// Only proceed with high-confidence bypass if token is valid
if (process.env.TRADING_MODE === 'live' && candidate.confidence >= 10) {
  console.log(`🎯 TRADING MODE: High-confidence candidate with validated token`);
  // Continue with processing...
}
```

## Expected Behavior
1. All LP candidates will have their tokens validated before processing
2. Validation will retry with progressive delays (500ms, 1000ms, 2000ms)
3. RPC endpoints will rotate on retry for better success rates
4. Only candidates with valid tokens will proceed to trading signals
5. High-confidence candidates still bypass mathematical validation but require valid tokens

## Debug Output
You should now see:
```
🔄 Token validation retry 1/3 for <tokenMint>: Invalid param: not a Token mint
🔄 Token validation retry 2/3 for <tokenMint>: Invalid param: not a Token mint
✅ Token validation successful for <tokenMint>
🎯 TRADING MODE: High-confidence candidate with validated token (12)
```

## EPIPE Error Fix
The EPIPE error was likely caused by the grep command terminating while the Node process was still writing. This is a display issue, not a code issue.
