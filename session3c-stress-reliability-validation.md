# Session 3C: Stress & Reliability Testing Report
**Date**: 2025-08-30
**Focus**: Critical Failure Scenarios and Sustained Load Testing

## Executive Summary
The system demonstrates partial resilience to critical failures (75% recovery rate) but struggles under sustained high load (23.44% success rate). While foundation and integration are solid, the system requires optimization before production deployment for live meme coin trading.

**Overall Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **INVESTIGATE ISSUES** before production

## Prerequisites Status
‚úÖ Session 3A Foundation Verification PASSED
‚úÖ Session 3B Integration Validation PASSED (with minor issues)

## Step 1: Critical Failure Scenarios Testing

### Test Execution
**Script**: `scripts/test-critical-failures.js`
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIAL PASS** (6/8 scenarios recovered)

### Critical Failure Test Results

| Scenario | Status | Recovery Time | Details |
|----------|--------|---------------|---------|
| Network connectivity loss | ‚úÖ PASSED | 1.1s | Recovered successfully after network restoration |
| External service 500/503 errors | ‚úÖ PASSED | 2.0s | System handled service errors gracefully |
| Memory exhaustion | ‚úÖ PASSED | 1ms | Memory released, system stable |
| Circuit breaker cascade prevention | ‚úÖ PASSED | 0ms | Prevented cascade with fast failures |
| Component crash recovery | ‚úÖ PASSED | 1.0s | System recovered from component failure |
| Malformed response handling | ‚úÖ PASSED | 4ms | All responses handled without crashes |
| Chainstack P2Pify failure | ‚ùå FAILED | Timeout | Failover did not complete within 5s |
| Helius rate limiting | ‚ùå FAILED | N/A | Fallback not working (0/10 succeeded) |

### Recovery Metrics
- **Average recovery time**: 0.7s ‚úÖ (< 30s requirement)
- **Maximum recovery time**: 2.0s ‚úÖ (< 30s requirement)
- **Cascade prevention rate**: 50% ‚ö†Ô∏è (target >90%)
- **Success rate**: 75% ‚ö†Ô∏è (6/8 scenarios)

### Critical Issues Identified
1. **Endpoint Failover Problem**: System struggles to failover between endpoints when primary fails
2. **Rate Limiting Handling**: No effective fallback when Helius endpoint is rate-limited
3. **Unhandled Promise Rejections**: Multiple unhandled rejections during stress conditions

## Step 2: Sustained Load Validation

### Test Execution
**Script**: `scripts/test-sustained-load.js`
**Duration**: 2 minutes (demo) - normally 10 minutes
**Status**: ‚ùå **FAILED** (23.44% success rate)

### Sustained Load Test Results

| Metric | Requirement | Actual | Status |
|--------|-------------|--------|--------|
| Test duration | 10+ minutes | 2 minutes* | ‚ö†Ô∏è DEMO |
| Total requests | N/A | 21,998 | - |
| Success rate | 95%+ | 23.44% | ‚ùå FAILED |
| Average throughput | N/A | 183.1 req/s | ‚úÖ GOOD |
| Memory growth | < 2%/hour | 85%/hour | ‚ùå FAILED |
| Circuit breaker events | N/A | 0 | ‚ö†Ô∏è NOT TRIGGERED |

*Note: Test shortened to 2 minutes for demonstration

### Performance Over Time
| Time | Memory | Success Rate | Throughput | Total Requests |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|----------------|
| 0.5 min | 7.71MB | 100.0% | 170.9 req/s | 5,126 |
| 1.0 min | 6.67MB | 48.1% | 178.8 req/s | 10,728 |
| 1.5 min | 7.68MB | 31.5% | 181.9 req/s | 16,373 |
| 2.0 min | 7.93MB | 23.4% | 183.3 req/s | 21,998 |

### Key Observations
1. **Rapid Performance Degradation**: Success rate dropped from 100% to 23.4% within 2 minutes
2. **"No available endpoints" errors**: Persistent endpoint availability issues under load
3. **Memory Growth Concern**: 85% hourly growth rate indicates potential memory leak
4. **Throughput Stability**: Despite failures, throughput remained consistent (170-183 req/s)

## Success Criteria Evaluation

### Step 1: Critical Failure Recovery ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL
- ‚úÖ Network timeouts recover within 30 seconds (1.1s achieved)
- ‚úÖ 500/503 errors trigger appropriate handling (2.0s recovery)
- ‚úÖ Memory exhaustion triggers graceful degradation
- ‚úÖ Individual component crashes don't kill other components
- ‚úÖ Malformed responses handled without crashes
- ‚ùå Chainstack failures don't trigger proper failover
- ‚ùå Helius rate limiting has no effective fallback
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Circuit breaker prevents only 50% of cascade failures (target >90%)

### Step 2: Sustained Operation ‚ùå FAILED
- ‚ùå System cannot maintain 95%+ success rate (23.44% achieved)
- ‚ùå Memory growth exceeds acceptable limits (85%/hour vs 2%/hour max)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Test duration shortened (2 min vs 10 min requirement)
- ‚úÖ Performance consistency maintained (12.5 req/s variance)
- ‚ùå Circuit breaker not activating when needed

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issues
1. **Endpoint Management Failure**
   - All endpoints becoming unavailable simultaneously
   - Poor failover logic between Chainstack, Helius, and Public RPC
   - No recovery mechanism when all endpoints fail

2. **Resource Exhaustion**
   - Memory growth suggests connection or promise leaks
   - Unhandled promise rejections accumulating
   - No backpressure mechanism when overwhelmed

3. **Circuit Breaker Ineffective**
   - Not triggering during sustained failures
   - Not preventing cascade failures effectively
   - Recovery mechanism not working properly

## Risk Assessment for Production

### üî¥ HIGH RISK Areas
- **Sustained Load Handling**: 23.44% success rate is unacceptable for trading
- **Memory Leaks**: 85%/hour growth would crash system within hours
- **Endpoint Failover**: Critical for 24/7 trading operations

### üü° MEDIUM RISK Areas  
- **Recovery Times**: While fast (avg 0.7s), not all scenarios recover
- **Circuit Breaker**: Functions but not optimally (50% cascade prevention)

### üü¢ LOW RISK Areas
- **Throughput**: Consistent at 183 req/s even under stress
- **Component Isolation**: Individual failures contained
- **Basic Error Handling**: Malformed responses handled properly

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Fix Endpoint Management**
   - Implement proper connection pooling
   - Add endpoint health monitoring
   - Improve failover logic with exponential backoff

2. **Address Memory Issues**
   - Investigate and fix promise leaks
   - Add proper cleanup for failed requests
   - Implement request cancellation

3. **Enhance Circuit Breaker**
   - Lower threshold for activation
   - Implement per-endpoint circuit breakers
   - Add adaptive recovery timing

### Before Production Deployment
1. Run full 10-minute sustained load test after fixes
2. Achieve 95%+ success rate under load
3. Verify memory stability over 1+ hour operation
4. Test with real Solana network congestion scenarios

## Final Verdict

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **NOT PRODUCTION READY**

**Rationale**:
- Critical failure recovery: 75% (6/8) - Acceptable but not ideal
- Sustained load success: 23.44% - Critically insufficient
- Memory stability: 85%/hour growth - Unacceptable for 24/7 operation
- Endpoint reliability: Major failures in failover scenarios

**Required for Production**:
1. ‚úÖ Foundation verified and working (Session 3A)
2. ‚úÖ Integration layer functional (Session 3B)
3. ‚ùå Stress handling insufficient (Session 3C)
4. ‚ùå Reliability under load not demonstrated

## Next Steps
1. **Fix Critical Issues**
   - Endpoint management and failover
   - Memory leak investigation
   - Circuit breaker optimization

2. **Re-test After Fixes**
   - Run full 10-minute sustained load test
   - Verify all 8 failure scenarios recover
   - Confirm memory stability

3. **Production Readiness Criteria**
   - 95%+ success rate under sustained load
   - <2% memory growth per hour
   - All critical failures recover within 30s
   - 90%+ cascade failure prevention
