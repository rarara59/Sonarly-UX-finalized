## Integration Verification

### RPC Pool Compatibility
- ✅ Original file compiles successfully
- ✅ Integration stub added at line 854-860
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
- ✅ Ready for Phase 3 orchestrator integration

### Integration Interface
```javascript
// Phase 3 integration pattern:
const batchManager = new BatchManager({
  batchWindow: 50,
  maxBatchSize: 100,
  enableBatching: true
});

// Add request to batch
const result = await batchManager.addRequestWithExecutor(
  method,
  params,
  options,
  executor
);

// Or simpler without executor
const promise = await batchManager.addRequest(method, params, options);

// Access metrics
const metrics = batchManager.getMetrics();
console.log(`Efficiency: ${metrics.efficiencyPercentage}`);
```

## Key Features

### Batch Accumulation
- Configurable time window (default 50ms)
- Maximum batch size limits
- Automatic grouping by method/options
- First-in-first-out request ordering

### Trigger Mechanisms

- Timeout trigger: Execute after window expires
- Manual flush: Execute on demand
- Clear timer on size trigger for efficiency

### Response Routing
- Promise-based individual responses
- Maintains request-response mapping
- Transforms results per method type
- Error propagation to all batch members

### Method Mapping
- Configurable batchable methods
- Maps individual to batch methods
- Supports custom mappings
- Filters non-batchable requests

### Performance Optimization
- Sub-millisecond batch formation
- Minimal memory overhead
- Efficient promise handling
- Timer accuracy tracking

### Monitoring & Metrics
