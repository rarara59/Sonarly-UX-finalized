PROMPT 3C4: Complete System Trading Scenario Testing
SINGLE FOCUS: Test complete system under realistic meme coin trading scenarios
EXPLICIT FILE PATHS:

Create: tests/integration/trading-scenarios.test.js
Import: Complete orchestrated system

INCREMENTAL IMPLEMENTATION:

Create viral meme coin discovery scenario (50+ requests)
Create portfolio monitoring scenario (20+ requests)
Test complete system handles both scenarios
Measure system performance under realistic trading loads
Validate all optimizations contribute measurable benefit

CLEAR SUCCESS CRITERIA:

Both trading scenarios complete successfully
System maintains >50% success rate under trading load
Component optimizations show measurable benefit
System remains stable throughout both scenarios

REQUIREMENTS-BASED VALIDATION:

Success rate: >50% for viral meme scenario, >60% for portfolio monitoring
Component benefits: Cache >25% hit rate, batching >30% reduction, hedging >5% improvement
System stability: All components healthy after both scenarios
Performance: Complete scenarios in <10 minutes total
