## COMPONENT WIRING AND INTEGRATION ORDER

### **Component Dependency Graph**:
```
Level 1 (No Dependencies):
├── TokenBucket (rate limiting)
├── CircuitBreaker (failure detection)
└── RequestCache (caching)

Level 2 (Configuration Dependencies Only):
├── EndpointSelector (depends on endpoint config)
└── ConnectionPoolCore (depends on HTTP config)

Level 3 (Component Dependencies):
├── BatchManager (depends on ConnectionPoolCore)
└── HedgedManager (depends on EndpointSelector + ConnectionPoolCore)

└── RpcManager (depends on all 7 components)
```

### **Component Integration Flow**:
```javascript
// Request flow through integrated components:

2. → TokenBucket.hasTokens() (rate limiting check)
3. → CircuitBreaker.execute() (failure protection wrapper)
4. → EndpointSelector.selectEndpoint() (load balancing)
5. → RequestCache.get() (deduplication and caching)
6. → BatchManager.addRequest() (request batching optimization)
7. → HedgedManager.hedgedRequest() (parallel request optimization)
8. → ConnectionPoolCore.execute() (actual HTTP request)
9. ← Response flows back through all layers
10. ← Final response returned to caller
```

### **Component Initialization Order**:
```bash
# Startup sequence (dependency order):
1. Load configuration and validate environment variables
2. Initialize Level 1 components (TokenBucket, CircuitBreaker, RequestCache)
3. Initialize Level 2 components (EndpointSelector, ConnectionPoolCore)
4. Initialize Level 3 components (BatchManager, HedgedManager)
5. Initialize Level 4 orchestrator (RpcManager with all dependencies)
6. Start health monitoring and error handling
7. System ready for trading operations
```

## ROLLBACK AND RECOVERY PROCEDURES

### **Rollback Points**:
- **After Phase 0**: Can abort if orchestration framework has fundamental flaws
- **After Phase 1**: Can revert to original monolithic file if extraction fails
- **After Phase 2**: Can use working components with simplified orchestration
- **After Phase 3**: Can deploy with known integration limitations
- **After Phase 4**: Can deploy with known real-world limitations

### **Recovery Procedures**:
```bash
# Rollback to last working state
git stash                           # Save current work
git checkout rpc-monolithic-backup  # Return to proven working system
git cherry-pick <working-components> # Selectively apply successful components

# Selective component rollback
mv src/detection/transport/token-bucket.js src/backup/  # Remove problematic component
# Continue with 6-component system instead of 7-component
```

### **Risk Mitigation**:
- **Component Failure**: System continues with degraded capability (80%+ functionality)
- **Integration Failure**: Fall back to simpler orchestration without optimization
