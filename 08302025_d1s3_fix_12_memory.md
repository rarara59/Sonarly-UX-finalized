PROBLEM IDENTIFIED: Memory growth of 578%/hour blocks 24/7 operation, need automated process recycling solution using existing system architecture

SINGLE FOCUS: Configure PM2 to manage system-main.js entry point with automatic memory-based restarts

EXPLICIT FILES:
- Primary: ecosystem.config.js - PM2 configuration pointing to system-main.js entry point
- Secondary: system/main.js - Ensure proper startup/shutdown for PM2 management
- Integration: Verify SystemOrchestrator handles PM2 restart signals gracefully

INCREMENTAL PROCESS:
Step 1: Create PM2 ecosystem.config.js pointing to system-main.js (or main entry point)
Step 2: Ensure SystemOrchestrator supports graceful shutdown on SIGTERM/SIGINT
Step 3: Test PM2 starts system-main.js which starts SystemOrchestrator correctly
Step 4: Validate all components start in proper dependency order through existing orchestrator
Step 5: Test PM2 automatic restart at 150MB memory limit
Step 6: Verify system recovers completely after PM2 restart (all components operational)
Step 7: Configure PM2 auto-startup and monitoring for production deployment

CLEAR SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- PM2 starts existing system architecture through system-main.js entry point
- SystemOrchestrator manages component startup/shutdown as designed
- Automatic restarts maintain all system functionality including RPC pool, health monitoring
- Zero changes needed to existing component architecture or startup sequences
- Complete system recovery after PM2 memory-based restart

REQUIREMENTS-BASED VALIDATION:
MEASURE: PM2 integration with existing system architecture and automatic restart behavior
ACHIEVE: Fully automated 24/7 operation using existing SystemOrchestrator design
NOT: Changes to component startup order or orchestrator architecture

INTEGRATION CONSTRAINT: Preserve existing system-main.js → SystemOrchestrator → Components startup flow
