### TOKEN LIFECYCLE CRITERIA IMPLEMENTATION:

**Fresh Gem Detection (<30 minutes):**
- LP creation timestamp tracking
- Smart wallet participation scoring  
- Minimum liquidity thresholds
- No verified metadata requirement
- High edge score from early indicators

**Established Token Tracking (30min-24h):**
- Metadata verification checks
- Volume >1,000 transactions requirement
- Market cap >$250K or holder count >1,000
- Consistent smart wallet or pattern-based edge

**Scam Protection (All stages):**
- Honeypot detection via test transactions
- Top holder concentration analysis (<30% threshold)
- Smart wallet dump rate monitoring (<80% threshold)
- Mint authority validation
- Duplicate token filtering

**Edge Cases Handled:**
- Late Blooming Fresh Gems (re-evaluation within 30min window)
- Early Established Candidates (qualification after initial failure)
- Delayed "Hot" Tokens (surge detection after 24h with smart wallet re-entry)

## EFFICACY-FIRST CHECKPOINTS

**After Phase 4:** System must provide comprehensive risk-managed opportunities with multi-layer protection
**After Phase 5:** System must outperform manual detection by 60+ seconds
**After Phase 6:** System must run reliably 24/7 without manual intervention
**After Phase 7:** System must provide advanced alpha that manual traders cannot access

**STOP BUILDING IF:** Any phase fails to demonstrate clear efficacy improvement over previous phase.
