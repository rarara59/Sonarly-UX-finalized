PROMPT 4D1: Trading-Optimized Production Deployment
SINGLE FOCUS: Deploy production-ready system with trading-specific monitoring and alerting
EXPLICIT FILE PATHS:

CREATE: scripts/deploy-trading-system.sh
CREATE: scripts/trading-monitor.js
CREATE: scripts/alert-manager.js
IMPORT: ecosystem.config.js from 4B2

INCREMENTAL IMPLEMENTATION:

Create streamlined deployment script for meme coin detection system
Implement trading-specific monitoring (detection rates, signal quality, competitive timing)
Configure alerts for trading-critical failures (detection stopped, signal quality degraded)
Test deployment script creates fully functional trading system
Validate monitoring captures trading performance metrics accurately
Test alert system triggers on trading-relevant issues, not just infrastructure
Create rollback capability for deployment failures

CLEAR SUCCESS CRITERIA:

Deployment script creates fully operational meme coin detection system
Trading monitoring tracks detection rates, signal quality, and competitive timing
Alerts trigger on trading-critical issues within 60 seconds
Rollback capability tested and functional within 2 minutes
System operational under production configuration

REQUIREMENTS-BASED VALIDATION:

Deployment Speed: Complete deployment in <10 minutes
Trading Monitoring: Tracks detection rate, signal accuracy, competitive timing
Alert Responsiveness: Trading-critical alerts within 60 seconds
Rollback Speed: Complete rollback in <2 minutes if needed
Production Readiness: System fully operational after deployment
Monitoring Overhead: <3% performance impact from monitoring systems
