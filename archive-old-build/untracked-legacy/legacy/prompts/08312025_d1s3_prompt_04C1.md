PROMPT 4C1: High-Volatility Trading Performance Validation
SINGLE FOCUS: Validate system performance during extreme market conditions when profits are highest
EXPLICIT FILE PATHS:

CREATE: scripts/test-market-volatility.js
CREATE: scripts/simulate-viral-events.js
CREATE: results/volatility-performance.json (output)
IMPORT: Complete system with PM2 configuration

INCREMENTAL IMPLEMENTATION:

Create viral meme coin event simulator (1000x volume spikes, network congestion)
Test system performance during simulated token launch frenzies
Validate detection accuracy when Solana network is congested
Test circuit breaker behavior during high-failure-rate periods
Measure system recovery time after extreme volatility events
Validate endpoint failover works during RPC provider overload
Test component isolation prevents cascading failures during profit opportunities

CLEAR SUCCESS CRITERIA:

System maintains >70% detection accuracy during 1000x volume spikes
Circuit breaker protects system without blocking profit opportunities
Endpoint failover maintains service during RPC provider overload
System recovers to full capability within 2 minutes after volatility events
Component failures don't cascade during high-profit periods

REQUIREMENTS-BASED VALIDATION:

Volatility Performance: >70% accuracy during simulated viral events
Network Congestion: System functions during 10x normal Solana transaction volume
Circuit Protection: Breaker prevents overload without blocking profitable signals
Recovery Speed: <2 minutes to restore full detection after volatility spike
Profit Preservation: System captures opportunities during high-volatility periods
Cascade Prevention: Single component failures don't crash system during viral events
