PROBLEM IDENTIFIED: Memory leak measurements invalid due to 98% failure rate from placeholder RPC endpoints blocking accurate testing

SINGLE FOCUS: Configure real working Solana RPC endpoints to enable valid memory leak measurement

EXPLICIT FILES: 
- Primary: .env (root directory) - Replace placeholder URLs with real RPC endpoints
- Secondary: scripts/test-sustained-load.js - Modify to validate endpoint connectivity
- Validation: src/detection/transport/rpc-connection-pool.js - Verify endpoints load correctly

INCREMENTAL PROCESS:
Step 1: Add real Helius RPC endpoint URL with valid API key to .env file
Step 2: Add real Chainstack P2Pify endpoint URL with valid API key to .env file
Step 3: Add public Solana RPC endpoint (https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com) as fallback
Step 4: Test single getSlot() RPC call to each endpoint individually (verify connectivity)
Step 5: Run 2-minute sustained load test with 10 concurrent requests to validate endpoints
Step 6: Verify success rate >80% (confirms endpoints are working properly)
Step 7: Run full 10-minute memory test with --expose-gc flag and measure growth rate
Step 8: Calculate memory growth percentage per hour from 10-minute measurement

CLEAR SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- All 3 RPC endpoints respond successfully to individual getSlot() test calls
- Sustained load test achieves >80% success rate (vs current 1.8% with placeholders)
- Memory growth measurement is valid and meaningful (not failure-pattern noise)
- System demonstrates stable RPC connectivity for accurate memory profiling
- No modification to existing RPC connection pool logic (focus only on configuration)

REQUIREMENTS-BASED VALIDATION:
MEASURE: RPC endpoint success rate and accurate memory growth rate with working external services
ACHIEVE: >80% RPC success rate enabling valid memory leak assessment and measurement
NOT: Complex endpoint management, connection pool changes, or RPC logic modifications

CONTEXT: Previous memory fixes targeted RPC pool logic but tests were invalid due to placeholder endpoints causing 98% failure rate. Need working endpoints to measure actual memory patterns.

CRITICAL CONSTRAINT: Do not modify RPC connection pool implementation - only configure working endpoint URLs for testing
