PROMPT 3B2: Add RequestCache to 4-Component Chain
SINGLE FOCUS: Add RequestCache to existing 4-component chain
EXPLICIT FILE PATHS:

Modify: tests/integration/4-component-chain.test.js
Import: RequestCache component

INCREMENTAL IMPLEMENTATION:

Add RequestCache with 1000 max entries, 15s TTL
Integrate caching into existing 4-component request flow
Test cache reduces actual RPC calls with duplicate requests
Test cache hit/miss behavior with TTL expiration
Validate cache doesn't break existing component chain

CLEAR SUCCESS CRITERIA:

Test passes with 5-component integrated chain
Cache hit rate >30% with duplicate request pattern
Fewer RPC calls made than requests submitted
Existing component functionality preserved

REQUIREMENTS-BASED VALIDATION:

Cache effectiveness: >30% hit rate with realistic patterns
RPC reduction: <80% of requests result in actual RPC calls
Success rate: >60% with 5-component overhead
Chain integrity: Rate limiting and circuit breaker still functional
