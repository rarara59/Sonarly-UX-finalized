PROMPT 4C2: Trading System Resilience and Recovery Validation
SINGLE FOCUS: Validate system recovers gracefully from failures without losing trading opportunities
EXPLICIT FILE PATHS:

CREATE: scripts/test-trading-resilience.js
CREATE: scripts/failure-recovery-validator.js
CREATE: results/resilience-report.json (output)
IMPORT: Complete system with volatility testing from 4C1

INCREMENTAL IMPLEMENTATION:

Test component failure isolation during active meme coin detection
Simulate RPC provider failures during token launch periods
Validate system maintains detection capability with degraded components
Test recovery procedures restore full functionality without losing signals
Validate cache and batch components fail gracefully without data loss
Test system behavior when multiple components fail during profit opportunities
Generate comprehensive resilience report with trading impact analysis

CLEAR SUCCESS CRITERIA:

System maintains >60% detection capability during single component failures
RPC provider failures don't stop meme coin opportunity detection
Component recovery restores full functionality within 90 seconds
No trading signals lost during component failure/recovery cycles
Multiple component failures don't crash entire detection system

REQUIREMENTS-BASED VALIDATION:

Failure Isolation: Single component failure maintains >60% system capability
Trading Continuity: Detection continues during component failures
Recovery Speed: Components recover within 90 seconds of failure resolution
Signal Preservation: No trading opportunities lost during failure/recovery
Multi-Failure Tolerance: System survives 2 simultaneous component failures
Graceful Degradation: System reduces features rather than crashing completely
