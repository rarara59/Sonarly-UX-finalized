PROMPT 4D3: Deployment and Rollback Scripts
SINGLE FOCUS: Create production deployment and rollback automation
EXPLICIT FILE PATHS:

Create: scripts/deploy-production.sh
Create: scripts/rollback-deployment.sh

INCREMENTAL IMPLEMENTATION:

Create blue-green deployment script for zero-downtime updates
Create automated rollback script for deployment failures
Add health validation during deployment process
Create deployment verification tests
Test deployment and rollback scripts work correctly

CLEAR SUCCESS CRITERIA:

Deployment script deploys system without downtime
Rollback script can revert deployment in <30 seconds
Health validation prevents bad deployments from going live
Scripts handle common deployment failure scenarios

REQUIREMENTS-BASED VALIDATION:

Deployment time: Complete deployment in <5 minutes
Rollback time: Complete rollback in <30 seconds if needed
Health validation: Deployment fails safely if system health checks fail
Zero downtime: No service interruption during successful deployment
