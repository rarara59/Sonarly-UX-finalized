PROMPT 4B2: Short-Duration Load Test
SINGLE FOCUS: Test system under continuous load for 10 minutes
EXPLICIT FILE PATHS:

Create: scripts/short-load-test.js
Import: Memory monitoring from 4B1

INCREMENTAL IMPLEMENTATION:

Configure system for sustained 20 requests per minute
Run continuous load test for 10 minutes
Monitor memory usage throughout test duration
Track component performance and error rates
Measure memory growth rate during sustained operation

CLEAR SUCCESS CRITERIA:

Test runs continuously for 10 minutes without crashing
System maintains >80% success rate throughout test
Memory growth measured and recorded
All components remain functional during test

REQUIREMENTS-BASED VALIDATION:

Duration: Complete 10-minute test without system failure
Success rate: >80% maintained throughout test duration
Memory stability: <50MB memory growth during 10-minute test
Component health: All components operational at test end
