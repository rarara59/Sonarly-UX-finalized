PROMPT 4D1: PM2 Configuration Generation
SINGLE FOCUS: Generate optimal PM2 configuration based on Phase 4B memory data
EXPLICIT FILE PATHS:

Create: ecosystem.config.js
Import: results/pm2-memory-calculations.json from 4B4

INCREMENTAL IMPLEMENTATION:

Load memory calculation data from Phase 4B testing
Calculate optimal memory limits for PM2 restart thresholds
Configure cluster sizing based on CPU cores and measured performance
Set restart parameters for 4-hour cycles with safety margins
Generate complete PM2 ecosystem configuration

CLEAR SUCCESS CRITERIA:

PM2 configuration file generates without errors
Memory limits calculated from actual test data
Configuration includes all required PM2 parameters
Restart cycle set to 4 hours based on memory growth projections

REQUIREMENTS-BASED VALIDATION:

Memory accuracy: Limits based on actual Phase 4B memory measurements
Safety margins: 20% buffer above projected 4-hour memory usage
Restart timing: 4-hour cycles Â±30 minutes based on growth rate calculations
Completeness: All required PM2 configuration parameters included
