PROBLEM IDENTIFIED: Memory cleanup patterns implemented but <2%/hour target not achieved

SINGLE FOCUS: Discover actual memory leak source through profiling

EXPLICIT FILE: ALL - Profile system-wide to identify real leak location  

INCREMENTAL PROCESS:
Step 1: Add heap profiling with --expose-gc flag
Step 2: Test with real Solana RPC endpoints (not placeholders)
Step 3: Profile SystemOrchestrator memory usage separately  
Step 4: Compare RPC pool vs orchestrator vs test harness memory growth
Step 5: Identify primary leak source with quantified data

CLEAR SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- Heap snapshots identify component contributing >50% of memory growth
- Memory growth source isolated to specific module/component
- Quantified measurement of leak rate per component
- Clear action plan for Fix Session 5B based on data

REQUIREMENTS-BASED VALIDATION:
MEASURE: Memory usage per system component during sustained load
ACHIEVE: Identification of actual leak source with >80% confidence
NOT: More cleanup patterns without knowing where leaks actually occur
