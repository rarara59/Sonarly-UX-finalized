PROMPT 3A4: Foundation Chain Performance Testing
SINGLE FOCUS: Validate 3-component chain performance under real network load
EXPLICIT FILE PATHS:

Create: tests/integration/foundation-performance.test.js
Import: All 3 foundation components + helper

INCREMENTAL IMPLEMENTATION:

Create performance test for 3-component chain
Execute 30 requests through complete chain
Measure end-to-end latency through all components
Validate component overhead is reasonable
Test with multiple real Solana endpoints

CLEAR SUCCESS CRITERIA:

Test completes successfully with real network calls
Average latency <5s per request (realistic for real network)
Success rate >70% with 3-component overhead
All components remain healthy after test

REQUIREMENTS-BASED VALIDATION:

Latency measurement: Average <5000ms end-to-end
Success rate: >70% with real Solana network
Component health: All 3 components report healthy
Memory stability: <10% memory growth during test
