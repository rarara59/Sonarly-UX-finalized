PROMPT 4B3: Extended Duration Load Test
SINGLE FOCUS: Test system under continuous load for 60 minutes
EXPLICIT FILE PATHS:

Create: scripts/extended-load-test.js
Import: Memory monitoring and load testing infrastructure

INCREMENTAL IMPLEMENTATION:

Configure system for sustained 15 requests per minute (lower for longer test)
Run continuous load test for 60 minutes
Monitor memory usage and growth patterns
Track component-level memory consumption over time
Generate memory growth projections for PM2 calculation

CLEAR SUCCESS CRITERIA:

Test runs for full 60 minutes without system failure
System maintains >75% success rate for entire duration
Memory growth pattern established for PM2 calculation
Component memory usage tracked individually

REQUIREMENTS-BASED VALIDATION:

Duration: Complete 60-minute test without crashes or hangs
Success rate: >75% sustained over full test period
Memory growth: Establish growth rate (MB per hour) for each component
Performance degradation: <25% latency increase from start to end
