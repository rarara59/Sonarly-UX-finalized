PROMPT 4D2: Memory Monitoring Scripts Creation
SINGLE FOCUS: Create production memory monitoring and alerting scripts
EXPLICIT FILE PATHS:

Create: scripts/monitor-component-memory.js
Create: scripts/calculate-memory-limits.js

INCREMENTAL IMPLEMENTATION:

Create component-level memory monitoring for production use
Create memory limit calculation script that updates based on actual usage
Add alerting when components approach memory thresholds
Create memory trend analysis for proactive management
Test monitoring scripts work with complete system

CLEAR SUCCESS CRITERIA:

Memory monitoring tracks all 7 components in production
Alerting triggers at 80% of PM2 memory limits
Scripts can recalculate optimal limits based on actual usage patterns
Monitoring works during system operation without performance impact

REQUIREMENTS-BASED VALIDATION:

Monitoring accuracy: Component memory usage tracked within 5% accuracy
Alert timing: Alerts trigger at 80% of configured memory limits
Performance impact: <2% system overhead from monitoring
Trend analysis: Can identify memory growth patterns over time
