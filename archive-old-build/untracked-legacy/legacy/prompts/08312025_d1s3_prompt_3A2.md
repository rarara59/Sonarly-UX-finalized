PROMPT 3A2: TokenBucket + ConnectionPoolCore Integration
SINGLE FOCUS: Build 2-component integration chain with real Solana calls
EXPLICIT FILE PATHS:

Create: tests/integration/2-component-chain.test.js
Import: TokenBucket, ConnectionPoolCore, RealSolanaHelper

INCREMENTAL IMPLEMENTATION:

Initialize TokenBucket with 50 rps limit
Initialize ConnectionPoolCore with 20 max sockets
Create integration test that flows requests through both components
Test rate limiting prevents connection pool exhaustion
Validate with real Solana getTokenSupply calls

CLEAR SUCCESS CRITERIA:

Test passes with real Helius endpoint
Rate limiting activates (some requests rejected)
Connection pool shows >80% socket reuse
Successful requests return valid Solana token data

REQUIREMENTS-BASED VALIDATION:

Success rate: >60% (some rate limited, some successful)
Socket reuse: >80% efficiency
Response validation: Contains valid lamport amounts
Rate limiting: >20% requests rejected when over limit
