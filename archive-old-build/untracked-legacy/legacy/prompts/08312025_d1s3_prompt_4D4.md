PROMPT 4D4: Production Readiness Validation
SINGLE FOCUS: Final validation that system is ready for production deployment
EXPLICIT FILE PATHS:

Create: scripts/validate-production-readiness.js
Create: results/production-readiness-report.json (output)

INCREMENTAL IMPLEMENTATION:

Execute complete system validation with PM2 configuration
Test deployment scripts work correctly
Validate all monitoring and alerting systems functional
Execute final performance test under production configuration
Generate production readiness certification report

CLEAR SUCCESS CRITERIA:

System runs successfully under PM2 with calculated memory limits
All deployment and monitoring scripts functional
Final performance test meets baseline requirements
Production readiness report shows all systems green

REQUIREMENTS-BASED VALIDATION:

PM2 operation: System runs stably under PM2 with memory management
Script functionality: All deployment and monitoring scripts working
Performance validation: Meets or exceeds Phase 4A baseline metrics
Readiness score: >95% of production requirements satisfied
