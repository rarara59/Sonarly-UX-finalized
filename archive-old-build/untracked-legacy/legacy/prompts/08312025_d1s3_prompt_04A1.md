PROMPT 4A1: Live Meme Coin Detection System Validation
SINGLE FOCUS: Validate complete 7-component system detects actual meme coin opportunities with competitive timing
EXPLICIT FILE PATHS:

CREATE: scripts/validate-live-detection.js
CREATE: results/detection-performance.json (output)
IMPORT: Complete system (RpcManager, ComponentFactory, all 7 components)
IMPORT: scripts/real-solana-helper.js for authentic token addresses

INCREMENTAL IMPLEMENTATION:

Initialize complete 7-component system with production configuration
Execute real meme coin detection using actual tokens (BONK, WIF, PEPE, SAMO, POPCAT)
Test detection pipeline: new LP events → validation → risk analysis → signal generation
Measure detection latency from LP creation to signal output
Validate signals contain accurate trading data (liquidity, market cap, holder distribution)
Test system response during high-volume token activity periods
Save detection metrics for competitive analysis

CLEAR SUCCESS CRITERIA:

System detects real meme coin LP creation events within 30 seconds
Detection pipeline processes 20 real tokens with >85% signal accuracy
All 7 components function correctly during live token detection
Signal output contains valid trading data (price, liquidity, risk scores)
System maintains detection capability during network congestion periods

REQUIREMENTS-BASED VALIDATION:

Detection Speed: LP creation to signal output <30 seconds (vs retail 3-7 minutes)
Signal Accuracy: >85% of generated signals contain accurate token data
System Reliability: >90% uptime during 2-hour live detection test
Data Quality: All signals include liquidity, market cap, holder analysis
Competitive Timing: Measure detection speed vs manual DEXScreener analysis
Volume Handling: System processes tokens during 10x normal Solana activity
