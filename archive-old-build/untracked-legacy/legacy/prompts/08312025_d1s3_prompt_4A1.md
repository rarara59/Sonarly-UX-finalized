PROMPT 4A1: System Startup Validation
SINGLE FOCUS: Validate complete system starts successfully with production configuration
EXPLICIT FILE PATHS:

Create: scripts/validate-system-startup.js
Import: RpcManager, ComponentFactory, all components

INCREMENTAL IMPLEMENTATION:

Create production-like configuration for all 7 components
Initialize complete system using ComponentFactory
Test system startup sequence completes without errors
Validate all components report healthy status
Test graceful system shutdown

CLEAR SUCCESS CRITERIA:

System starts without errors or exceptions
All 7 components initialize in correct dependency order
ComponentFactory returns healthy system status
System shuts down gracefully without hanging

REQUIREMENTS-BASED VALIDATION:

Startup time: Complete initialization in <30 seconds
Component health: All 7 components report "healthy" status
Memory usage: System initialization uses <200MB
Shutdown time: Graceful shutdown completes in <10 seconds
