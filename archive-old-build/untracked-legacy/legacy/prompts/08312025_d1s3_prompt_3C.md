PROMPT 3C: Complete System Integration Testing
SINGLE FOCUS: Test all 7 components + orchestrator working together as complete system
EXPLICIT FILE PATHS:

Target: tests/integration/complete-system.test.js
System Under Test: All 7 components + RpcManager orchestrator + error handling

INCREMENTAL IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS:
Step 1: Test complete system startup with RpcManager orchestrator coordinating all 7 components
Step 2: Test end-to-end request flow through all optimization layers (complete component chain)
Step 3: Test system behavior under realistic load patterns simulating trading scenarios
Step 4: Test complete system failure and recovery scenarios (individual components failing and recovering)
Step 5: Test system performance against original monolithic version baseline comparison
CLEAR SUCCESS CRITERIA:
Complete System Requirements:

Integration success: All 7 components work together seamlessly through orchestrator
Performance parity: Equal or better performance than original 98% success rate monolithic system
API compatibility: Existing call(method, params) interface preserved and functional
Error handling: Graceful system degradation when individual components fail

Performance Requirements:

End-to-end latency: <200ms for realistic Solana RPC calls through complete component chain
Success rate: 95%+ under 20 concurrent requests with all optimization components active
Memory usage: <300MB for sustained operation with all 7 components active
Throughput capacity: 500+ requests/second with all optimization features enabled

REQUIREMENTS-BASED VALIDATION:
Measure These Metrics:

Complete system success rate (target: 95%+ under realistic load matching original performance)
End-to-end latency (target: <200ms average for real RPC calls through optimization chain)
Memory usage stability (target: <300MB sustained operation, <1% growth per hour)
Throughput capacity (target: 500+ req/sec with all optimization components active)
Component coordination efficiency (target: No bottlenecks between orchestrated components)
