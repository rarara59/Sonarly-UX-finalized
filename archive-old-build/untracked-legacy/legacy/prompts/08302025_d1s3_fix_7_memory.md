PROBLEM IDENTIFIED: Memory growth 339%/hour blocks 24/7 trading operation

SINGLE FOCUS: Implement memory cleanup to achieve <2%/hour growth

EXPLICIT FILE: src/detection/transport/rpc-connection-pool.js - Add cleanup patterns to call() method

INCREMENTAL PROCESS:
Step 1: Add finally block cleanup to call() method (timers, controllers, inFlight tracking)
Step 2: Add queue pruning before processQueue() execution (expired item removal)
Step 3: Add background leak guard with unref() (stuck request cleanup)
Step 4: Test memory growth <2%/hour over 10 minutes sustained load
Step 5: Validate success rate maintains 90%+ (no regression)

CLEAR SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- Memory growth reduces from 339%/hour to <2%/hour measured over 10 minutes
- System operates continuously without memory exhaustion
- Success rate maintains 90%+ (no functional regression)
- Cleanup adds <5ms latency overhead to request processing

REQUIREMENTS-BASED VALIDATION:
MEASURE: Memory usage every minute during sustained load testing
ACHIEVE: <2%/hour growth rate enabling 24/7 trading operation
NOT: Complex memory management algorithms or garbage collection tuning

KNOWN SOLUTION AREAS (for Claude Code guidance):
- Request lifecycle cleanup (timers, abort controllers, tracking maps)
- Queue maintenance (expired item removal, reference nulling)
- Background cleanup (periodic stuck request handling)
