PROMPT 2B: Circuit Breaker Component Testing
SINGLE FOCUS: Create comprehensive test suite for extracted circuit-breaker.js component
EXPLICIT FILE PATHS:

Target: tests/unit/circuit-breaker.test.js
Component Under Test: src/detection/transport/circuit-breaker.js

INCREMENTAL IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS:
Step 1: Create test framework and mock services for CircuitBreaker class isolated testing
Step 2: Test CLOSED → OPEN state transitions with controlled failure scenarios
Step 3: Test OPEN → HALF_OPEN → CLOSED recovery cycles with success/failure patterns
Step 4: Test per-service isolation (multiple independent services with separate circuit states)
Step 5: Test timing accuracy, jitter handling, and concurrent execution safety
CLEAR SUCCESS CRITERIA:
State Machine Requirements:

State transitions: 100% accuracy for all CLOSED→OPEN→HALF_OPEN→CLOSED transitions
Failure threshold: Opens circuit after exactly configured number of failures
Cooldown timing: Respects configured timeout before HALF_OPEN transition (±5% accuracy)
Per-service isolation: 100 different services tracked independently without state interference

Performance Requirements:

State check latency: <1ms per execute() call including all state machine logic
Memory per service: <1KB overhead per tracked service for complete state management
Recovery detection: <3 successful probes to transition from HALF_OPEN to CLOSED
Concurrent safety: 1000 concurrent execute() calls without race conditions or state corruption

REQUIREMENTS-BASED VALIDATION:
Measure These Metrics:

State transition accuracy (target: 100% correct transitions under all test scenarios)
Failure threshold precision (target: Opens within 1 failure of configured threshold)
Cooldown timing accuracy (target: Within 5% of configured timeout duration)
Service isolation effectiveness (target: 100 services function independently)
Concurrent execution safety (target: 1000 concurrent calls, 0 race conditions detected)

Mock Service Testing Approach:

Create controllable mock services that can fail or succeed on demand
Test circuit breaker behavior with various failure patterns and recovery scenarios
Validate state persistence and accuracy across multiple service calls
Test recovery behavior with gradual service improvement patterns
