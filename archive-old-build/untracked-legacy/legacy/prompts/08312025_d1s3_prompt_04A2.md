PROMPT 4A2: Trading Competitive Advantage Measurement
SINGLE FOCUS: Measure and validate system's speed advantage over retail manual trading methods
EXPLICIT FILE PATHS:

CREATE: scripts/measure-competitive-edge.js
CREATE: results/competitive-analysis.json (output)
IMPORT: Detection system from 4A1
IMPORT: scripts/real-solana-helper.js for timing baselines

INCREMENTAL IMPLEMENTATION:

Execute side-by-side comparison: system detection vs simulated manual analysis
Measure time from token launch to trading signal for both methods
Test detection accuracy during viral meme coin events (high transaction volume)
Validate component optimizations provide measurable trading advantages
Test system behavior when multiple tokens launch simultaneously
Calculate potential profit opportunities captured vs missed by speed advantage
Generate competitive advantage report with quantified benefits

CLEAR SUCCESS CRITERIA:

System consistently outperforms simulated manual analysis by >5x speed
Detection accuracy remains >80% during high-volume viral events
Component optimizations (caching, batching, hedging) show measurable benefits
System captures >90% of token opportunities vs <30% for manual methods
Competitive advantage quantified in time savings and opportunity capture

REQUIREMENTS-BASED VALIDATION:

Speed Advantage: System 5-15x faster than manual DEXScreener monitoring
Viral Event Performance: >80% accuracy during 100x volume spikes
Component Benefits: Cache >40% hit rate, batching >25% RPC reduction, hedging >10% reliability improvement
Opportunity Capture: System detects >90% of token launches vs manual <30%
Profit Potential: Quantified advantage in potential trading opportunities
Consistency: Speed advantage maintained across different market conditions
