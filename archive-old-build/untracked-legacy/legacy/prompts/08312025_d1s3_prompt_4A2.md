PROMPT 4A2: Basic RPC Functionality Validation
SINGLE FOCUS: Test basic RPC calls work correctly through complete system
EXPLICIT FILE PATHS:

Create: scripts/validate-basic-rpc.js
Import: Complete system from 4A1

INCREMENTAL IMPLEMENTATION:

Execute getTokenSupply call through complete system
Execute getAccountInfo call through complete system
Execute getTokenLargestAccounts call through complete system
Validate all responses contain correct Solana data formats
Test with all three endpoints (Helius, Chainstack, Public)

CLEAR SUCCESS CRITERIA:

All 3 RPC method types execute successfully
Responses contain valid Solana data (lamports, decimals, addresses)
All 3 endpoints work through the system
No type errors processing blockchain responses

REQUIREMENTS-BASED VALIDATION:

Success rate: >95% for basic RPC calls
Response validation: All responses contain expected Solana fields
Endpoint coverage: All 3 configured endpoints used successfully
Latency: Average <5 seconds per call through complete system
