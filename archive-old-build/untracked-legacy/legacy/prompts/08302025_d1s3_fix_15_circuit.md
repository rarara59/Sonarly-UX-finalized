PROBLEM IDENTIFIED: Circuit breaker cascade prevention 50% blocks enterprise-grade reliability (target: 90%+ required)

SINGLE FOCUS: Implement per-endpoint circuit breakers to achieve 90%+ cascade prevention rate

EXPLICIT FILE: src/detection/transport/rpc-connection-pool.js - Replace single circuit breaker with per-endpoint isolation

INCREMENTAL PROCESS:
Step 1: Profile current cascade failure patterns (identify how single endpoint failures affect healthy endpoints)
Step 2: Implement per-endpoint circuit breaker state tracking (Map<endpoint, BreakerState>)
Step 3: Isolate endpoint selection to skip OPEN breakers only (healthy endpoints continue working)
Step 4: Test cascade prevention ≥90% during simulated endpoint failures (Helius, Chainstack, Public)
Step 5: Validate independent endpoint recovery (one endpoint HALF_OPEN → CLOSED doesn't affect others)
Step 6: Verify no success rate regression (maintain 95.3% overall success rate)
Step 7: Test system resilience during multiple simultaneous endpoint failures

CLEAR SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- Cascade prevention rate improves from 50% to ≥90% measured during endpoint failure simulation
- Individual endpoint failures (Helius down) don't trigger circuit breakers on healthy endpoints (Chainstack, Public)
- Endpoint recovery happens independently (Helius CLOSED while Chainstack remains OPEN)
- Success rate maintains ≥95% (no functional regression from circuit breaker changes)
- System continues operating with any single healthy endpoint available

REQUIREMENTS-BASED VALIDATION:
MEASURE: Cascade prevention percentage during controlled endpoint failure scenarios
ACHIEVE: ≥90% cascade prevention rate enabling enterprise-grade system resilience
NOT: Complex state synchronization algorithms or sophisticated failure prediction systems

KNOWN SOLUTION AREAS (for Claude Code guidance):
- Per-endpoint state management (individual circuit breaker per RPC endpoint)
- Endpoint selection filtering (skip OPEN breakers during endpoint rotation)
- Independent failure tracking (separate failure counts, recovery timers per endpoint)
- State isolation (endpoint recovery doesn't affect other endpoint breaker states)

CURRENT SYSTEM STATE:
- Success rate: 95.3% ACHIEVED (production ready)
- Memory management: STABLE (PM2 4-hour cycles working)
- Endpoint failover: WORKING (Toyota fix delivering <5s failover)
- Circuit breaker: 50% cascade prevention (need 40 percentage point improvement)
- Overall production readiness: 95% (final optimization for enterprise reliability)
