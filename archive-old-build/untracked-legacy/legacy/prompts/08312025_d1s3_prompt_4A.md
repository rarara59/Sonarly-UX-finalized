PROMPT 4A: Complete System Validation Against Real Solana Mainnet
SINGLE FOCUS: Validate complete 7-component system against real external Solana services
EXPLICIT FILE PATHS:

Target: scripts/validate-complete-system.js
System Under Test: Complete 7-component modular architecture with real external dependencies

INCREMENTAL IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS:
Step 1: Test system startup and all component initialization with production configuration
Step 2: Test basic RPC calls against real Solana mainnet endpoints (Helius, Chainstack P2Pify, Public)
Step 3: Test all 7 components working together with real network conditions and latencies
Step 4: Test system performance under realistic trading load patterns with actual network overhead
Step 5: Compare modular system performance against original monolithic baseline with same external services
CLEAR SUCCESS CRITERIA:
Real Service Integration Requirements:

Solana mainnet connections: Helius, Chainstack P2Pify, and Public RPC all functional through system
All 7 components: Each optimization component contributing measurable benefit with real services
Trading system latency: <200ms end-to-end with actual network conditions and service response times
Memory stability: <1% growth per hour during realistic trading load with real external calls

Performance Requirements:

Success rate: 95%+ under 20 concurrent requests to real Solana RPC services
Latency consistency: P95 latency remains stable throughout test duration with network variance
Component effectiveness: Each optimization component provides >10% measurable benefit
Error handling: Graceful handling of real network conditions, timeouts, and service failures

REQUIREMENTS-BASED VALIDATION:
Measure These Metrics:

Real-world success rate (target: 95%+ success with actual Solana mainnet services)
End-to-end latency with network overhead (target: <200ms P95 including real network latency)
Component contribution analysis (target: Each component provides >10% measurable improvement)
Memory usage during real load (target: <300MB sustained with real external service calls)
Error recovery effectiveness (target: 100% graceful handling of real network failures)

Real Service Testing Requirements:

Test with actual Solana mainnet data (block heights >250M, real token supplies, account queries)
Validate all endpoint types work correctly through complete component stack
Test during various network conditions (peak hours, off-peak, network congestion)
Measure and validate improvement from each optimization component with real service latencies
