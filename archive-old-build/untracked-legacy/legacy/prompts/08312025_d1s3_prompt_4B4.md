PROMPT 4B4: Memory Analysis and PM2 Data Generation
SINGLE FOCUS: Analyze memory test results and generate data for PM2 configuration
EXPLICIT FILE PATHS:

Create: scripts/analyze-memory-data.js
Create: results/pm2-memory-calculations.json (output)

INCREMENTAL IMPLEMENTATION:

Analyze memory data from 4B2 and 4B3 tests
Calculate memory growth rate per component and total system
Project memory usage for 4-hour operational cycles
Generate recommended PM2 memory limits with safety margins
Save PM2 configuration data for Phase 4D

CLEAR SUCCESS CRITERIA:

Memory analysis completes without errors
Growth rates calculated for each component
PM2 memory limits calculated with 20% safety margin
Results saved to JSON file for PM2 configuration

REQUIREMENTS-BASED VALIDATION:

Analysis accuracy: Growth rates calculated from actual test data
Safety margins: PM2 limits include 20% buffer above projected usage
Component breakdown: Individual memory limits per component available
Data format: Results in format suitable for PM2 configuration generation
