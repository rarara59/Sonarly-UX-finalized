PROMPT 4C2: Component Failure Simulation
SINGLE FOCUS: Test system behavior when individual components fail
EXPLICIT FILE PATHS:

Create: scripts/test-component-failures.js
Import: IntegrationErrorHandler from Phase 0C

INCREMENTAL IMPLEMENTATION:

Simulate TokenBucket failure and test system fallback behavior
Simulate RequestCache failure and validate caching degrades gracefully
Simulate BatchManager failure and test individual request processing
Test IntegrationErrorHandler isolates failed components correctly
Validate system maintains >70% functionality during single component failures

CLEAR SUCCESS CRITERIA:

System continues operating when individual components fail
IntegrationErrorHandler isolates failed components
Failed components don't crash entire system
System functionality degrades gracefully rather than failing completely

REQUIREMENTS-BASED VALIDATION:

Isolation effectiveness: Failed components don't affect healthy components
Graceful degradation: >70% system functionality maintained during single failure
Error handling: Clear error attribution to specific failed component
Recovery capability: System can re-integrate recovered components
