const cache = new RequestCache({
  maxEntries: 10000,
  defaultTTL: 250,
  enableCoalescing: true
});

// Cache with automatic fetching
const cacheKey = cache.generateKey(method, params, options);
const result = await cache.get(cacheKey, async () => {
  // Execute RPC call
  return await rpcCall(method, params);
}, ttl);

// Access metrics
const metrics = cache.getMetrics();
console.log(`Hit rate: ${metrics.hitRate}`);
```
