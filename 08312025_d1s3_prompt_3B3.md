PROMPT 3B3: Extended Chain Performance Validation
SINGLE FOCUS: Validate 5-component chain performance with realistic trading patterns
EXPLICIT FILE PATHS:

Create: tests/integration/extended-performance.test.js
Import: All 5 extended chain components

INCREMENTAL IMPLEMENTATION:

Create realistic meme coin trading request pattern
Execute 50 requests through 5-component chain
Measure performance impact of each component addition
Test concurrent request handling (5 parallel streams)
Validate system stability under extended load

CLEAR SUCCESS CRITERIA:

Test completes with realistic trading patterns
System handles concurrent requests successfully
Performance degradation acceptable with 5 components
All components remain healthy after extended test

REQUIREMENTS-BASED VALIDATION:

Success rate: >60% with 5-component chain under concurrent load
Average latency: <6000ms end-to-end with real network
Concurrent safety: >80% success with 5 parallel request streams
Component health: All 5 components healthy after test
