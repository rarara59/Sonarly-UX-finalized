PROBLEM IDENTIFIED: Memory leak confirmed at 96.5% success rate showing 615%/hour growth, blocking 24/7 operation

SINGLE FOCUS: Create Node.js memory profiling script to identify objects causing retention during successful operations

EXPLICIT FILES:
- Primary: scripts/profile-memory-objects.js - Node.js memory profiling script
- Secondary: scripts/analyze-memory-growth.js - Memory growth analysis script
- Target: src/detection/transport/rpc-connection-pool.js - Apply identified fixes

INCREMENTAL PROCESS:
Step 1: Create Node.js script using process.memoryUsage() and --inspect flag
Step 2: Add object tracking to identify growing collections (Maps, Arrays, closures)
Step 3: Run 5-minute profiling test with memory snapshots every 30 seconds
Step 4: Generate memory growth report showing object count increases
Step 5: Add heap dump generation using v8.writeHeapSnapshot()
Step 6: Identify specific code patterns causing object accumulation
Step 7: Implement targeted cleanup based on object growth data

CLEAR SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- Memory profiling script runs successfully with real endpoints
- Object growth patterns identified with specific counts/sizes over time
- Growing object types traced to specific code locations in RPC pool
- Targeted cleanup reduces memory growth to <10%/hour validation test

REQUIREMENTS-BASED VALIDATION:
MEASURE: Node.js process memory usage and object allocation patterns over time
ACHIEVE: Data-driven identification of specific objects not being garbage collected
NOT: Chrome DevTools manual analysis or external browser-based profiling tools

PROFILING APPROACH: Use Node.js built-in profiling (process.memoryUsage, v8.writeHeapSnapshot, --inspect flag) for automated analysis
