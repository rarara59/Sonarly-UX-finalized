# Sonarly VisionCamera Fix: Complete Step-by-Step Sequence

## Current Status
‚úÖ **COMPLETED:** Native `PPGFrameProcessor.m` integrated into Xcode project  
‚ùå **REMAINING:** JavaScript frame processor implementation  
üéØ **GOAL:** Complete VisionCamera PPG heart rate detection system

### Prompt 2.3: Build and Deploy to Device

```
Build and deploy the app to a physical iOS device to test PPG functionality. PPG detection requires physical device camera + flash.

1. Clean build folders: rm -rf ios/build ios/Pods ios/Podfile.lock
2. Reinstall pods: cd ios && pod install
3. Build in Xcode with proper code signing
4. Deploy to device and test camera + flash functionality
5. Monitor device logs for PPG frame processor debug messages
6. Test finger placement on camera to verify PPG signal detection

Ensure the build succeeds and the app runs with frame processing active on physical device.
```

**Expected Output:** App running on device with frame processor debug logs
