PROMPT 4C4: System Recovery Validation
SINGLE FOCUS: Test system recovery capabilities and resilience patterns
EXPLICIT FILE PATHS:

Create: scripts/test-system-recovery.js
Create: results/failure-recovery-report.json (output)

INCREMENTAL IMPLEMENTATION:

Execute complete failure and recovery cycle for each component
Test system recovery from complete network connectivity loss
Validate all components can restart and re-initialize after failures
Test system performance returns to baseline after recovery
Generate comprehensive failure recovery report

CLEAR SUCCESS CRITERIA:

All components can recover from failure states
System performance returns to baseline after recovery
Recovery times are reasonable for production use
Recovery report documents all tested scenarios

REQUIREMENTS-BASED VALIDATION:

Component recovery: All 7 components can recover from failure states
Performance recovery: System returns to >90% baseline performance after recovery
Recovery time: Components recover within 60 seconds of failure resolution
Documentation: Complete report of all failure/recovery scenarios tested
