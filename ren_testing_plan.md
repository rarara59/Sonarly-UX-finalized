```
$ ./design_comprehensive_test_suite_phase_2
Building systematic test coverage for remaining 19 critical scenarios
Focus: Integration, edge cases, performance, security vulnerabilities
Target: 100% production confidence before deployment
```



✅ Test #1: RPC returns null for getTokenSupply → Does Line 458 crash?
$ ./test_critical_scenario_01 null_supply_data
Testing: RPC returns null for getTokenSupply → Line 458 crash scenario
Target: Prove/disprove parseInt(undefined) crash during viral meme coin launch
This test will systematically prove whether Line 458 crashes during RPC failures. It simulates 9 real-world scenarios based on actual Helius/ChainStack RPC failure modes:

Key Test Scenarios:
NULL responses (complete RPC failure)
Missing amount field (partial RPC failure - most common)
Undefined/empty values (data corruption)
Control test (working case)

✅ Test #2: Empty Accounts Array Crash
Target: Lines 311-314 - largestAccounts.value[0] access without bounds checking
Scenario: Fresh token with no holder data returns empty array
Prediction: Will crash with "Cannot read properties of undefined"

RENAISSANCE TEST #2: EMPTY ACCOUNTS ARRAY CRASH
This test targets the critical scenario I identified:

Target: Lines ~477-483 array access without bounds checking
Scenario: largestAccounts.value[0] when fresh token has no holders yet
Critical Timing: First 60 seconds = highest profit window for meme coins

Key Test Focus:

Scenario 1 (Most Critical): Empty array {value: []} - 90% of fresh tokens
Financial Impact: Crash during first 60 seconds = miss entire 15-minute profit cycle
Competitive Edge: Fresh gem detection is our biggest advantage over retail

✅ Test #3: RPC returns {value: []} for getTokenLargestAccounts → Array[0] crash?
Lines 147-148: Race condition in queue cleanup
Scenario: Multiple tokens processed simultaneously
Impact: Memory corruption during high-volume periods

Scenario: Viral meme launch with 10+ tokens per second processing
Critical Impact: System instability during highest profit periods

Key Test Scenarios:
Cleanup During Active Validation - Queue cleanup runs while tokens being processed
Concurrent Add/Remove - High-volume processing with simultaneous queue operations
Rapid-Fire Processing - 20+ tokens simultaneously (viral event simulation)
Memory Pressure - Stuck validations causing memory buildup
Iterator Corruption - Concurrent modifications during cleanup loops

What This Tests:
Memory Corruption: Inconsistent state between validationQueue and validationQueueTimestamps
System Crashes: Exceptions during concurrent queue operations
Partial Deletions: One delete succeeds, other fails = memory leaks
High-Load Stability: System behavior during viral meme events

✅ Test #4: RPC returns malformed account objects [{address: "...", amount: undefined}]
Target:
Volume calculations: String concatenation vs numeric math
Division operations: NaN propagation in percentage calculations
Type coercion bugs: JavaScript's implicit string-to-number conversions

Critical Scenarios:
Volume data arrives as strings from RPC
Math operations create NaN chains
Percentage calculations become invalid

This test targets critical mathematical vulnerabilities I identified:

Target: All mathematical operations throughout token analysis
Scenario: RPC returns strings, mixed types, invalid formats
Critical Impact: Wrong calculations = Bad trades, NaN contamination = Corrupted analysis

Key Mathematical Operations Tested:

Volume/Liquidity Ratios - Division operations with string inputs
Holder Percentages - Security analysis math with type coercion
Buy/Sell Ratios - Organic activity calculations including ÷0 scenarios
Supply Metrics - parseInt operations and power calculations
Risk Scores - Averaging and normalization across mixed types

Critical Test Scenarios:

All String Inputs - RPC returns everything as strings (common)
Mixed Types - Some strings, some numbers (realistic)
Empty/Zero Values - Edge cases that break calculations
Undefined/Null - Missing data scenarios
Invalid Formats - "1,000,000", "50K", "80%" formats
Extreme Values - Very large numbers, tiny decimals
Fresh Token Data - Minimal data scenarios

What This Tests:

String Concatenation Bug: "1" + "2" = "12" instead of 3
NaN Propagation: parseInt("abc") creates NaN that spreads
Division by Zero: Creates Infinity values that break comparisons
Type Coercion: JavaScript's implicit conversions causing wrong results

## INTEGRATION & EXTERNAL DEPENDENCIES (Tests 5-8)

✅ ### Test #5: Risk Module Integration Timeout/Errors
**What**: External risk modules (ScamProtectionEngine, LiquidityRiskAnalyzer, MarketCapRiskFilter) failures
