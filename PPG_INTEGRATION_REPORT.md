# PPGFrameProcessor.m Xcode Integration Report

## ✅ Integration Completed Successfully

### Changes Made to project.pbxproj:

1. **PBXBuildFile Section**
   - Added: `PPGFP990AA4F2B38EB /* PPGFrameProcessor.m in Sources */`
   - This ensures the file will be compiled

2. **PBXFileReference Section**
   - Added: `PPGFP17A333D0E56B1 /* PPGFrameProcessor.m */`
   - File reference with correct path: `Sonarly/PPGFrameProcessor.m`
   - File type: `sourcecode.c.objc`

3. **Main Group Section**
   - Added PPGFrameProcessor.m to the file list alongside AppDelegate.mm
   - Ensures file appears in Xcode navigator

4. **Sources Build Phase**
   - Added to Compile Sources for the Sonarly target
   - Will be compiled when building the app

### File IDs Generated:
- File Reference ID: `PPGFP17A333D0E56B1`
- Build File ID: `PPGFP990AA4F2B38EB`

### Verification Results:
- ✅ File exists at: `ios/Sonarly/PPGFrameProcessor.m`
- ✅ 4 references found in project.pbxproj
- ✅ Added to PBXBuildFile section
- ✅ Added to PBXFileReference section
- ✅ Added to Sources build phase
- ✅ Listed with other source files

## Manual Verification Steps:

1. **Open Xcode**
   ```bash
   open ios/Sonarly.xcworkspace
   ```

2. **In Xcode, verify:**
   - PPGFrameProcessor.m appears in the Navigator panel under Sonarly folder
   - Go to Target > Build Phases > Compile Sources
   - Confirm PPGFrameProcessor.m is listed there
   - The file should have a checkbox next to it (checked)

3. **Clean and Build**
   - Clean Build Folder: `Cmd+Shift+K`
   - Build: `Cmd+B`

4. **Check Build Output**
   - Look for "Compiling PPGFrameProcessor.m" in build output
   - No errors related to missing symbols from PPGFrameProcessor

## Frame Processor Implementation Status:

### Native Side (iOS) ✅
- PPGFrameProcessor.m implemented with:
  - Proper VisionCamera imports
  - Frame processor registered as "detectPPG"
  - Debug logging for verification
  - Basic frame dimension extraction

### JavaScript Side ❌ (Still needs implementation)
- Need to create frame processor usage in React Native code
- Example implementation needed:
  ```javascript
  import { useFrameProcessor } from 'react-native-vision-camera';
  import { runOnJS } from 'react-native-reanimated';
  
  const frameProcessor = useFrameProcessor((frame) => {
    'worklet';
    const result = detectPPG(frame);
    runOnJS(handlePPGData)(result);
  }, []);
  ```

## Troubleshooting:

If PPGFrameProcessor.m doesn't appear in Xcode after reopening:
1. Close Xcode completely
2. Run:
   ```bash
   cd ios
   pod deintegrate
   pod install
   ```
3. Open Xcode again with `open Sonarly.xcworkspace`

If build fails with undefined symbols:
1. Ensure VisionCamera pod is installed
2. Check that PPGFrameProcessor.m target membership is set to "Sonarly"
3. Verify the file isn't accidentally set to "Do Not Build"

## Scripts Created:
- `/scripts/add-ppg-to-xcode.js` - Adds PPGFrameProcessor.m to project
- `/scripts/verify-ppg-integration.sh` - Verifies integration status

## Next Steps:
1. Open Xcode and verify visual confirmation
2. Clean and build the project
3. Implement JavaScript side frame processor usage
4. Test frame processor is being called with debug logs
